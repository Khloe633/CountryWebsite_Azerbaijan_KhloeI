    <p class="pa">Kebabs! There are many types of kebabs that use many different types of meat, such as chicken, beef, lamb. The lyulya kebab in particular is a very popular staple in Azerbaijan. The meal includes ground lamb that’s grilled and then served on skewers. The kebab is seasoned with black pepper and salt to make the taste better. The meal is usually paired with a serving of a few diced onions, or other vegetables.

    <p class="pa">Dolma is an Azerbaijani dish that is made by wrapping and stuffing a precooked and fresh grape leaf with meat (particularly lamb meat), rice, onions, and other spices and herbs. Fun fact!: the name is a shortened version of the Turkic word “doldurma” meaning “stuffed”, pretty fitting for the dish.

    <div class="card" id="plov">
    <h1 class="foodtext">Plov</h1>
    <img src="images/plov.jpg">
    <p class="pa">Plov, the most popular Azerbaijan dish, despite having Uzbek origins. What makes it so deserving of that title? Well, look at it. Doesn’t it look appealing??? Plov is a rice dish that  consists of yellow rice, meat (particularly either beef or lamb), carrots and onions, and seasoned with an assortment of spices. The dish is typically large, like a family sized thanksgiving dinner. You can also pair this with dolma!, or other vegetables like cauliflower.
