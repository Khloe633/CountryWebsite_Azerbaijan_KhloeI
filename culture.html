       Ever wanted to hear music from a different country? You’re in luck! Azerbaijani music is full of many different genres and influences, from folk music (or mughan music) to classical music, to even hip hop music in more modern times. Different artists from this time include Alim Qasimov, known for his revolutionary blend of traditional Azerbaijani folk music with jazz and Rashid Behbudov, known as the “golden voice of Azerbaijan” for his rare vocal talent. Another important part of the country's music is the instruments, including tar, a guitar-like instrument, and saz, another long necked guitar-like instrument.

       In Azerbaijan, etiquette matters!! Especially when you’re talking to an elder, you need to be kind to them, and show a bit of hospitality to them. Elders are main priority when it comes to giving hospitality. Also, it is considered normal and encouraged to refuse an offer from someone twice before accepting it. DO NOT bring alcohol to family gatherings, eat with your right hand, offer sweets and make sure to remove your shoes before entering a person’s home. While touring, make sure to dress in a modest matter, especially when you’re next to religious areas (like mosques). Tea also plays a big role into etiquette, and is something you’ll find in any household you come across.

       The main, and most dominant religion is islam, specifically, Shia muslims. Around 97% of the population are muslim, 62% being Shia and 35% being Sunni. How crazy is that?? The large percentage in muslim Azerbaijanis is connected to historic values and inherent customs rather than enforced by the government. In islam, muslims believe in one god (Allah) and his messenger, prophet Muhammad, pray 5 times a day, read a holy book called the Quran and give out charity.  While majority of the population might be Muslims, other religions, such as christianity and Judaism are also prominent in the country's landscape. When you visit the country, you’ll find plenty of mosques, which are the places of worship for muslims.
